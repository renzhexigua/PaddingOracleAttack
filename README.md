  > In this project you will experiment with a padding oracle attack against a toy web site hosted at crypto-class.appspot.com.
    Padding oracle vulnerabilities affect a wide variety of products, including secure tokens.
    This project will show how they can be exploited.
    We discussed CBC padding oracle attacks inLecture 7.6, but if you want to read more about them, please see Vaudenay's paper.
